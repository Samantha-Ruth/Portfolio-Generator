# Professional Portfolio Generator

## Description

This project worked with node and npm dependencies to automatically generate a professional portfolio markdown document based on user input.  

This project helped me understand how to work from the command line using node.js.  To do this, I learned about the node package manager (npm), specifically the "inquirer" dependency to prompt user for information and the node file system to write new files, and I learned about Javascript ES6 language and the use of arrow functions.  I also was introduced to template literals, how to modularize the code using "require" and "module.exports", and how to refactor the code and use a promise chain.  I also learned how to destructure templateData to create variables to hold data for conditional sections (eg license), how to utilize the spread and rest operators, and how to create a function with a template literal. I also learned how to use the keyword "new" to create a promise object with resolve and reject parameters.

## Installation

If the user already has node installed on their device, they can download this project and run "npm init" and then "npm install" to download the dependencies.  Next, the user should enter "node index.js" into their command line. 

## Usage

User enters "node app.js" into the command line.  The user will receive a series of prompts, asking for name, GitHub username, information for the About section, name and description, languages used, GitHub link, and whether or not the project will be featured or not.  

When the user is finished entering their information, a ReadMe.md file is created with the user's name on top, GitHub Link, about me, and projects.  The page also has a link to the GitHub at the bottom.
